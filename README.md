# Slime-Mold-Simulation
Visualization of the Dijkstra's algorithm in a grid-based environment. Every step is displayed by highlighting visited cells, simulating a slime-like growth.
The visualization tries to imitate the movement of Physarum polycephalum.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library


## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SMollov/Slime-Mold-Simulation.git
```
    
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

Run the script:

```bash
python3 slime.py
```

## Usage

1. Press Run.

2. Left-click to select start and end points.

3. The algorithm will display the simulation. The steps can be repeated after the search is done.
